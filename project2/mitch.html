        <h1>Speeding in Seattle</h1>
        <p> Let's propose a situation. One day, you're driving home. The roads are empty, and you decide you want to be home a little quicker that day. You begin gently edging that throttle, and soon find yourself going 25 over when you see the dreaded blue
            and red lights behind you. You know your boned, so you pull over and accept your fate. </p>
        <br>
        <p> In this unfortunate event, you can thankfully look to Mitch Greene from speeding in Seattle to caress you. Mr. Greene has over 25 years of experience, and from personal experience, will get you out of that ticket.</p>
