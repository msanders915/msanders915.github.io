        <h1>Red Light Cameras</h1>
        <p>Red light cameras are a common employed method by police to ticket drivers for automotive infractions without an officer actually having to be on site. These cameras are installed on the corners of intersections with traffic lights and are able
            to ticket drivers for speeding, running red lights and taking a non-legal right on right (when specifcally stated on road sign). However as long as you stay vigilant of road signs, getting a ticket from a red light camera is hardly possible.</p>
